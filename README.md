# Setting up the bot

When you first add the bot to your server, you'll need to set it up and configure it to suit your server. 

The first step to setting up the bot is running the setup command, this command allows you to configure the server for the first time.

In order too start the setup, use "-set".

**Note-:** Using "-set" without any arguments gives you all available options to set for your server
